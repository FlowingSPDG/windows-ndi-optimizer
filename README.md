# windows-ndi-optimizer[WIP]
Optimize Windows's network/NIC driver settings for NewTek's NDI(Network-Device-Interface).

### How it works
This is batchfile developed to automatically optimize Windows's Network and NIC driver settings for NewTek's NDI(network device interface).  
Currently following optimizations are supported:

- TODO.

And following are not supported(yet):
- Fix network speed(1G,2.5G,10G etc.)
- Settings for NDI itself(use NDI AccessManager)
- Disable NIC low-energy network settings such as EEE.
- Make network(s) private.
